Some of you asked for some references on the issues we discussed at the end of class today. Here they are, in alphabetical order: 

- E. Anderson's [contribution](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=74339) to a symposium on Amartya Sen's philosophy.
- C. Bicchieri, ['Norms of cooperation'](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2381782).
- M. Gilbert, ['Rationality in Collective Action'](http://pos.sagepub.com/content/36/1/3.short).
- S. Nichols, ['On The Genealogy Of Norms: A Case For The Role Of Emotion In Cultural Evolution'](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/341051).
- A. Rosenberg, ['Darwinism in moral philosophy and social theory'](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yjk0eeybxsn19qi/Rosenberg.pdf).

Also worth checking out, although I can't give you an electronic version of them, are: 

- R. Frank,  'Cooperation through emotional commitment', in R. Nesse, et al., *The Evolution of Commitment*, pp. 57â€“76.
- Skyrms, *The Evolution of the Social Contract*.
