You should have all received two different emails asking you to fill out two [Doodle](https://doodle.com/) polls. One is for scheduling in-class presentations. The other one is for scheduling make up sessions. Please <a href="mailto:&#x61;&#x70;&#x65;&#x72;&#x65;&#x7A;&#x63;&#x61;&#x40;&#x75;&#x73;&#x63;&#x2E;&#x65;&#x64;&#x75;">contact me</a> as soon as possible if you did not receive either of those two emails.
