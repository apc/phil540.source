The readings for next week are now listed [here](http://perezcarballo.org/phil540/readings/).

I have updated the schedule until the first meeting after Spring Break. I will post the rest of the reading schedule shortly. 

If you are presenting on any given date, you are free to focus on one of the assigned readings, or a part thereof. But make sure to let me know in advance what you will be presenting on.
