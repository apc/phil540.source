Next week we will start by discussing Smith's ['Humean Rationality'](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195145399.001.0001/acprof-9780195145397) (which was assigned for [last week]() -- please remember to bring your copy of the handout!). We will then move on to talk about Lewis' ['Desire as Belief'](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2255078). (You can also take a look at [the sequel](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2254563) if you're so inclined.)

[Remember](http://perezcarballo.org/phil540/readings/): you can use the USC library [bookmarklet][1] to access the readings if you are off- campus.
