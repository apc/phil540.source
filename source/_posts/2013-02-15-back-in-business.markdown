Next week, we will be open for business as usual. I will get in touch with all of you soon to start thinking about make up sessions. 

For now, let us pick up where we left. I want to use the first third of the meeting (or so) to wrap up our discussion of Lewis on Desire as Belief. Please take a moment to look at [the sequel](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2254563), especially if you haven't yet.   

But the bulk of our discussion will revolve around [Chapter 6](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/019824908X.001.0001/acprof-9780198249085-chapter-6) of *Reasons and Persons*. 

(Note: There is a typo in the syllabus, I will fix it when I'm back in LA. The reading is *not* chapter 1, but chapter 6.)
