A few things: 

- I have updated the [reading schedule](http://perezcarballo.org/phil540/readings/) for the rest of the semester. Please [take a look](http://perezcarballo.org/phil540/readings/), especially if you will be giving an in-class presentation (you will notice it differs a fair bit from the tentative schedule on the syllabus).
- A final reminder to those of you taking this class for credit: you need to submit *three short response pieces* before the end of the semester. If you are writing on something we are reading for a given Tuesday, your response piece is due on the previous Sunday.   
- Also for those of you taking this class for credit: you should be thinking about scheduling a meeting with me to discuss your final paper. On the syllabus it is stated that this meeting should take place before March 31st. Since I had miscalculated when Spring break was going to be, I have decided to move that date forward until April 2. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
