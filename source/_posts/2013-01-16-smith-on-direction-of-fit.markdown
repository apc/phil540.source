In class yesterday I alluded to an argument due to Michael Smith. The argument, recall, was meant to show that no mental state could have both *world to mind* and *mind to world* directions of fit. For those of you who are curious, [this is the paper](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2253760) I had in mind.

Here is a representative passage (p. 56):

{% blockquote Michael Smith http://www.jstor.org/stable/2253760 'The Humean Theory of Motivation'%}
For, as we have understood the concept of direction of fit, the direction of fit of a state with the content that <em>p</em> is determined, <em>inter alia</em>, by its counterfactual dependence on a perception with the content that <em>not p</em>. A state with both directions of fit would therefore have to be such that <em>both</em>, in the presence of such a perception it tends to go out of existence, and, in the presence of such a perception, it tends to endure, disposing the subject that has it to bring it about that <em>p</em>. Taken quite literally, then, the idea that there may be a state with both directions of fit is just plain incoherent.

UPDATE: In answer to Matt's question: the passage is repeated *verbatim* on [Ch. 4](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2015884/Smith.TMP.Ch4.pdf) of *The Moral Problem* (p. 118).
