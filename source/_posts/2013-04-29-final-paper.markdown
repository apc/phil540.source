If you are enrolled in the seminar for credit, you must submit a final paper. Papers are due on **Monday May 13, 2013**, by email. If at all possible, please send your papers in PDF format.

Tomorrow is the last day I will be holding regular office hours. That said, if you want to talk to me about your paper, simply [email me](mailto:aperezca@usc.edu) so we can set up a time to meet.
