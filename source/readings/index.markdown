Some of the links below will take you directly to the electronic version of the paper or book chapter. In order to access those from an off-campus internet connection, you may need to use your library proxy server. To use the [USC Libraries](http://www.usc.edu/libraries/) one, simply drag [this link][1] to your bookmarks folder (for instructions see [here](http://consequently.org/news/2005/03/12/university_library_proxy_bookmarklet/)). 

The rest of the files are password protected. The password will be distributed during the first meeting.
